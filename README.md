Steam game recommendation algorithm based on user platform, budget, past games, and game ratings.

Created because I got frustrated at sponsored games taking up my entire home page, and wanted more tailored recommendations, especially the ability to filter by platform and similar games.

Rating weights and number of recommendations customizable.
